Reverse engineering realtek ethernet drivers step by step

Step 1
======

Find out whatâ€™s your driver in your linux system. 

sudo lspci -v



arun@lenovo-pc:~$ 


09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 10)


Get more info about driver 
modinfo driver_name

Step 2
=====

Make the build setup


Install the kernel headers
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

uname -a
Linux lenovo-pc 3.19.0-33-generic #38-Ubuntu XXXXX

b.  Download the kernel source code.
cd to linux-3.19/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/

C. sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

This should build the driver for realtek drivers.

Step 3
=====

Experimenting the driver 



Remove the existing driver
sudo rmmod r8169

     b.  Insert the the newly build driver 
	sudo insmod r8169.ko 

     c.  check the kernel message to see that the kernel driver has been inserted.

dmesg -c

[ 3522.019204] r8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 2.3LK-NAPI loaded

d.  Fun
grep -r "Gigabit Ethernet driver" *r8169.c:MODULE_DESCRIPTION("RealTek RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver");
r8169.c:		printk(KERN_INFO "%s Gigabit Ethernet driver %s loaded\n",

Edit the below lines 

       //printk(KERN_INFO "%s Gigabit Ethernet driver %s loaded\n",
        printk(KERN_INFO "%s this is a test :  Gigabit Ethernet driver %s loaded\n",


Now remove and add the newly compiled ethernet driver
sudo rmmod r8169.ko

make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=`pwd` modules

sudo insmod r8169.ko

Check the kernel message again :

[ 3840.201328] r8169 this is a test :  Gigabit Ethernet driver 2.3LK-NAPI loaded
